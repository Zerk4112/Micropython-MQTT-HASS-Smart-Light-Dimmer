"""
boot.py

This script initializes the hardware and network connections for a device.

It starts by loading settings from a JSON file, then initializes a rotary encoder and a LED bargraph.
Afterwards, it blinks the bargraph to indicate that the device is active.

The script then establishes WiFi and MQTT connections using the loaded settings.

Finally, it initializes a button for the rotary encoder and sets up variables for tracking changes in the rotary encoder's value.

This script is executed every time the device boots up.

Imports:
    - machine: Access to hardware-specific features
    - utime: Functions for time-related tasks
    - rotary_irq_esp: Driver for the rotary encoder
    - util: Utility functions for network connections
    - bargraph: Class for controlling the LED bargraph
