util.py

This module contains utility functions for loading settings from a JSON file and establishing MQTT connections.

Functions:
    - load_settings: Loads the settings from a 'settings.json' file and returns the data as a dictionary.
    - establish_mqtt_connection: Tries to establish a connection to an MQTT broker using the provided settings. If the connection fails, it blinks the LED bargraph and resets the device.

Imports:
    - machine: Access to hardware-specific features
    - utime: Functions for time-related tasks
    - ujson: JSON encoder and decoder
    - umqtt.simple: MQTT client
    - network: Network configuration
    - bargraph: Class for controlling the LED bargraph
